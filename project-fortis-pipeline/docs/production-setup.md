# Fortis production 

## Prerequisites

### Azure subscription

First and foremost, you'll need an Azure subscription. 

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications through our global network of datacenters. Integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace support you in efficiently building anything from simple mobile apps to internet-scale solutions.

A full list of products and services can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/).

And you can create an account for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

For this project we're using these services: [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/), [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/), [Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/), [Active Directory v2](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/), [Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/) and [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/).

### Secure your Fortis site with TLS

TLS is the successcor to SSL. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications. You can find more information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)

To enable TLS and secure your Fortis site, you have two choices:

1. Provide your own TLS certificate and private key
2. Generate a free certificate with LetsEncrypt

#### Required Deployment Parameters for TLS

* `Endpoint Protection` set to `tls_provide_certificate` or `tls_lets_encrypt`
* [`Active Directory Client Id`](./aad-setup.md) from `Azure Active Directory v2.0`
* `Ingress Hostname`
* `TLS Certificate` if not using LetsEncrypt
* `TLS Private Key` if not using LetsEncrypt
* `Lets Encrypt Email` if using LetsEncrypt

More details on TLS setup can be found [here](./tls-setup.md).

## Setting up a new Azure deployment

Hit the deploy to Azure button below:

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.svg)](https://deploy.azure.com/?repository=https://github.com/akshata29/project-fortis/tree/master?ptmpl=azuredeploy.parameters.json)

[Fill in the wizard](./azure-deploy-parameters.md) that comes up:

Now grab a large cup of coffee as the deployment can take north of an hour to
complete.

## Post Deployment

If you set up TLS, remember to do the [TLS post deployment steps](https://github.com/akshata29/project-fortis/blob/master/project-fortis-pipeline/docs/tls-setup.md#post-deployment-steps) and [AAD post deployment steps](https://github.com/akshata29/project-fortis/blob/master/project-fortis-pipeline/docs/aad-setup.md#post-deployment-steps) before viewing your site. Then, click on the `Manage your resources`
(highlighted below).

Now click on the `Tags` tab in the Azure Portal (highlighted below) and find the
`FORTIS_ADMIN_INTERFACE_URL` (also highlighted below).

Point your browser to the admin interface URL. Once the Fortis admin portal
loads, you can now finalize the setup of your Fortis deployment using the portal:

If you configured TLS and get `AADSTS70005: response_type 'id_token' is not enabled for the application`, make sure you completed all the post deployment steps properly.

Once you've completed all the [admin settings](./admin-settings.md), your
deployment is ready to be used.

## Updating your Fortis deployment

As new releases of Fortis get published, you may want to update your deployment
to take advantage of the newest features and improvements. To install a new
version of Fortis, you will have to execute the following command in a Bash
terminal such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about):

```sh
ssh fortisadmin@YOUR_DEPLOY_VM_IP "sudo ~/upgrade-fortis.sh RELEASE_TO_INSTALL"
```

The value for `YOUR_DEPLOY_VM_IP` can be found in the resource group into which
you originally deployed your Fortis site. Look for the resource named `fortisDeployPublicIP`
and copy its IP address.

The value for `RELEASE_TO_INSTALL` is the version of Fortis to which you wish to
update. A full list of all supported versions can be found on our [Github releases page](https://github.com/akshata29/project-fortis/releases).
